The User’s Friend List has a row for a previously added Friend with a valid email and an unchecked checkbox.\n*   **When:** @Invite: The User checks the Friend’s checkbox…\n*   **Then:**\n    *   @EmailPrep: YACA opens a pop-up window on the browser using the phone’s/desktop’s default email app to create an invitation email to the Friend.\n    *   The email’s Subject is pre-populated with the text “I am inviting you to YACA”.\n    *   @EmailBody: The email’s Body is pre-populated with the text “Please visit http://yaca-myandrewid.onrender.com to register and invite your own Friends.” (Ensure 'myandrewid' is correctly replaced or handled if it's a dynamic part based on the user).\n    *   @EmailSend: The User optionally adds a personalized message and clicks on Send to send the invitation, and closes the pop-up window.\n\n**Scoring:**\n- **Complete / Code OK (2.0 pts):** All 'Then' conditions are fully met. Checking the checkbox correctly triggers the default email client via a `mailto:` link. The subject and body are pre-populated as specified, with the URL in the body being correct and functional (or correctly placeholder-replaced).\n- **Partially Complete / Code Problematic (1.25 pts):** Most 'Then' conditions are met, but there are minor issues. For example, the email client opens, but the subject or body is incorrect/missing, the URL is malformed, or the checkbox interaction is clunky.\n- **Insufficient (0 pts):** The functionality is missing, fundamentally broken (e.g., email client doesn't open, critical pre-population fails), or significantly deviates from the requirements.\n\nFocus on: The event listener on the checkbox, correct `mailto:` link construction, and accurate pre-population of subject and body, including the specified URL (and any dynamic parts like 'myandrewid')."

Clicking a checked checkbox displays the specified alert. Upon acknowledging the alert, the checkbox becomes unchecked, allowing the user to subsequently re-check it to trigger a new invitation.\n- **Partially Complete / Code Problematic (0.75 pts):** Most 'Then' conditions are met. For example, the alert might appear but the text is wrong, or the checkbox doesn't uncheck correctly, or unchecking doesn't properly reset the state to allow a re-invite.\n- **Insufficient (0 pts):** The alert is missing, the checkbox state isn't managed correctly, or the re-invite flow is not possible as described.\n\nFocus on: The conditional logic for a checked checkbox click, the display of the correct alert message, the state change of the checkbox to unchecked, and ensuring the 'InvitesAFriend' flow can be initiated again."

The User’s Friend List has at least one row. Each Friend row has a button to the right of the friend card element with an X (cross) icon (hover text “Delete”) icon.\n*   **When:** The User decides to delete a Friend from the Friend list by clicking on the Delete icon…\n*   **Then:**\n    *   YACA pops up a confirmation window with the message “Are you sure you want to delete this Friend?” to confirm the action.\n    *   If The User clicks on Ok or Yes on the pop-up window Then: The pop-up window is closed.

A delete icon/button is present per friend. Clicking it shows the specified confirmation dialog. Clicking 'Ok/Yes' removes the correct friend row from the DOM. Clicking 'Cancel/No' leaves the list unchanged.\n- **Partially Complete / Code Problematic (2.0 pts):** Most conditions are met, but with issues. For example, the confirmation dialog might be missing or have the wrong message, the wrong friend is deleted, 'Cancel' still deletes, or the delete icon is not as specified.\n- **Insufficient (0 pts):** Deletion functionality is missing, does not work, does not include confirmation, or is fundamentally flawed.\n\nFocus on: Presence and functionality of the delete icon/button per friend, correct confirmation dialog (`window.confirm` or similar), and accurate DOM manipulation based on user's choice in the confirmation."

This implies the student has run Prettier and applied its formatting rules.\n- **Not Compliant (0 pts):** The codebase shows significant inconsistencies in formatting that deviate from what Prettier would enforce, or clear evidence that Prettier was not run or its suggestions ignored.\n\nFocus on: The visual consistency of code formatting (indentation, spacing, line breaks, etc.) in the relevant TypeScript files. The assessment may require the evaluator to run Prettier (or `prettier --check`) or be provided with evidence of a clean check. Minor, isolated inconsistencies might be acceptable if overall adherence is clear, but widespread issues indicate non-compliance."
