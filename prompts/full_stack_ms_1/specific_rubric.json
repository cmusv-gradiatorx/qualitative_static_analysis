    "specific_prompt": "Evaluate the 'Required Elements' on all four pages (`index.html`, `friends.html`, `chat.html`, `auth.html`). Check if all UI widgets and elements implied in the wireframes and specified in the starter page templates (clients/pages folder) are present with all necessary attributes (e.g., `id` attributes). \n\n**Key aspects to verify:**\n- Presence of all UI widgets seen on the wireframe (buttons, input fields, text areas, scrollbar placeholders, shaded areas/borders implying containers).\n- Correct `id` attributes and other mandatory attributes as indicated in starter templates.\n- Placement of widgets should be generally similar to the wireframe, determining overall layout and look-and-feel. Minor deviations are acceptable.\n- Adherence to additional constraints for each page from the wireframe document (e.g., fixed height, variable height for dynamic content).\n- For `friends.html` and `chat.html`, ensure fake hardcoded data is used to correctly represent the look-and-feel with list elements.\n\n**Assessment Guidelines:**\n- **Good (1 point)**: All or nearly all required elements are present with correct attributes, appropriate placement, and constraints are met. Hardcoded data is well-implemented.\n- **Needs Improvement (0.75 points)**: Several required elements are missing, attributes are incorrect/missing, placement significantly deviates, or constraints are not well handled. Hardcoded data might be partially missing or poorly implemented.\n- **Unsatisfactory (0 points)**: Many required elements are missing or fundamentally incorrect. Pages bear little resemblance to wireframes in terms of elements or structure."

    "criterion_name": "Consistency",
    "max_points": 1.0,
    "specific_prompt": "Evaluate the 'Consistency' of the UI across all four pages and within each page. This involves checking the reuse of common styles (defined in `styles.css` and potentially specialized in individual pages) to achieve a unified look-and-feel.\n\n**Key aspects to verify:**\n- Consistent color schemes, fonts, and typography across pages.\n- Uniform button styles and other interactive element appearances.\n- Similar container placement, spacing, margins, and padding where appropriate for a cohesive design.\n- Evidence of using a shared `styles.css` for common rules, with page-specific CSS for specialization, demonstrating the DRY principle.\n\n**Assessment Guidelines:**\n- **Good (1 point)**: Pages demonstrate strong internal and external consistency. Common styles are effectively reused from `styles.css`, leading to a cohesive and professional look-and-feel.\n- **Needs Improvement (0.75 points)**: Some inconsistencies in styling (e.g., different button styles on different pages, varying fonts, or spacing) are noticeable. Use of `styles.css` might be partial or not fully effective.\n- **Unsatisfactory (0 points)**: Pages lack consistency; elements are styled haphazardly with little or no reuse of common styles. Each page feels disconnected, or `styles.css` is minimally or incorrectly used."

    "specific_prompt": "Evaluate the 'Responsiveness' of the web pages. The pages should adapt gracefully to different screen sizes, particularly looking fine on desktop/laptop screens and narrower mobile screens (e.g., iPad, large iPhones) when rendered in Chrome. They should also respond well to window re-sizing.\n\n**Key aspects to verify:**\n- Layout adjusts appropriately when the browser window is resized.\n- Content remains legible and usable on smaller screens without excessive horizontal scrolling or distorted elements.\n- Elements reflow or resize sensibly to fit different viewport widths.\n- No significant visual breakage or overlapping of content on common screen sizes.\n\n**Assessment Guidelines:**\n- **Good (1 point)**: Pages are fully responsive, rendering well on both desktop and representative mobile screen widths without distortion or usability issues. Resizing the window shows smooth adaptation.\n- **Needs Improvement (0.75 points)**: Pages show some responsiveness, but there are noticeable issues on certain screen sizes (e.g., elements overlap, content becomes unreadable, horizontal scrolling is required for main content on mobile, or layout breaks significantly during resizing).\n- **Unsatisfactory (0 points)**: Pages are not responsive or poorly responsive. The layout is fixed and breaks badly on smaller screens or when the window is resized. Significant usability issues on mobile."

    "criterion_name": "Use of flexboxes",

    "specific_prompt": "Evaluate the 'Use of flexboxes' for page layout. All pages must use flexbox containers, nesting column and row flexboxes to achieve the desired layout for major parts of the wireframes.\n\n**Key aspects to verify:**\n- Primary layout structure is achieved using flexbox containers (`display: flex`).\n- Appropriate use of `flex-direction: row` or `flex-direction: column`.\n- Nesting of flexbox containers to structure different sections of the page as implied by the wireframes.\n- The flexbox container structure should be evident from inspecting the HTML/CSS and should closely match the intended layout from wireframes.\n\n**Assessment Guidelines:**\n- **Good (1 point)**: Flexbox is used appropriately and effectively as the primary layout mechanism. Nested flexbox containers clearly define the structure of major page sections, aligning well with wireframe layouts.\n- **Needs Improvement (0.75 points)**: Flexbox is used, but its application might be inconsistent, incorrect in some areas, or not fully leveraged for major layout components. Some parts of the layout might still rely heavily on older techniques where flexbox would be more appropriate, or the flex structure is hard to discern/doesn't match wireframes well.\n- **Unsatisfactory (0 points)**: Flexbox is minimally used, used incorrectly, or not used at all for major layout structuring. The layout relies primarily on outdated techniques or fails to achieve the wireframe structure."

    "criterion_name": "Proper use of CSS",
    "max_points": 1.0,
    "specific_prompt": "Evaluate the 'Proper use of CSS'. This includes assessing whether CSS is used correctly to define properties controlling element appearance, layout, and behavior. Consider both `styles.css` and page-specific CSS.\n\n**Key aspects to verify:**\n- Correct use of CSS properties for controlling wrapping, flow (e.g., flex item properties like `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, `flex-basis`), justification (`justify-content`), and alignment (`align-items`, `align-self`).\n- Appropriate application of typography (font families, sizes, weights), colors (background, text), and spacing (gaps, margins, padding).\n- Effective use of selectors to target elements without being overly broad or unnecessarily complex.\n- CSS rules in `styles.css` should define selectors and rules to be reused and potentially specialized in multiple pages.\n- Adherence to the instruction to ignore scroll behavior for now means you should not penalize for scroll implementation details, but general CSS for layout affecting potential scroll areas is relevant.\n\n**Assessment Guidelines:**\n- **Good (1 point)**: CSS is used properly and effectively. Properties for layout, typography, color, and spacing are correctly applied to achieve the desired visual outcome and behavior. `styles.css` is well-structured for reusability.\n- **Needs Improvement (0.75 points)**: CSS is generally functional, but there are some instances of incorrect property usage, inefficient selectors, or values that don't quite achieve the intended effect. Reusability in `styles.css` could be improved.\n- **Unsatisfactory (0 points)**: Significant issues with CSS usage. Properties are frequently misapplied, leading to incorrect layout or appearance. CSS might be disorganized, styles might conflict, or `styles.css` is poorly utilized."

This is a somewhat subjective measure of how clean, professional-looking, and legible the pages are.\n\n**Key aspects to consider:**\n- Visual clarity and readability of text and content.\n- Professionalism in terms of design choices (even if simple, should be neat).\n- Aesthetic appeal: does it look like a thoughtfully designed UI, even if basic?\n- Avoidance of cluttered or confusing layouts.\n\n**Assessment Guidelines:**\n- **Good (1 point)**: Pages are clean, professional-looking, and legible. The design is aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly, even if simple.\n- **Needs Improvement (0.75 points)**: Pages are generally functional but may lack polish. There might be some issues with legibility, visual clutter, or choices that detract from a professional appearance.\n- **Unsatisfactory (0 points)**: Pages have a poor overall appearance. They may be cluttered, difficult to read, or look unprofessional and hastily put together."

    "specific_prompt": "Verify if the student's work on any feature branches used for this MS1 assignment was merged to the `main` branch before submission. This is a procedural check based on submission instructions.\n\n**Assessment Guidelines:**\n- **Done (0 points)**: Evidence (e.g., Git history) indicates that feature branches related to this work were merged into the `main` branch prior to creating the grading branch. Report as 'Done'.\n- **Not Done (0 points)**: No evidence of feature branches being merged to `main`, or work was done directly on `main` without feature branches when they might have been appropriate for development stages. Report as 'Not Done'. (Note: The rubric states that 'Not Done' is subject to a -2 point deduction from the total assignment score, which is handled separately from this criterion's direct point award).\n\nYour task is to report the status ('Done' or 'Not Done') and assign 0 points as per the rubric for this item. The actual deduction is an administrative step."
