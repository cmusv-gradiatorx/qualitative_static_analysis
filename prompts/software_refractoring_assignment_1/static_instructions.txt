## Static Code Analysis Evaluation Instructions

You are evaluating the results of a static code analysis performed using Semgrep rules. The analysis has identified potential code quality issues, design pattern violations, and security concerns in the submitted codebase.

### Your Task:
1. **Review the static analysis findings** provided in the semgrep analysis results
2. **Evaluate each category of findings** (SOLID principles, security, performance, design patterns, code quality)
3. **Assess the severity and impact** of identified issues on code maintainability, security, and performance
4. **Provide specific recommendations** for addressing the most critical findings
5. **Consider the educational value** of each finding for graduate-level software engineering learning

### Evaluation Criteria:
- **Code Quality**: How do the findings reflect on overall code quality and maintainability?
- **Design Principles**: Are SOLID principles and other software engineering principles being followed?
- **Security**: Are there any security vulnerabilities or poor security practices?
- **Performance**: Are there performance issues that could impact system efficiency?
- **Best Practices**: Does the code follow industry best practices and coding standards?

### Response Structure:
1. **Static Analysis Summary**: Overview of findings by category and severity
2. **Critical Issues**: Highlight the most important issues that need immediate attention
3. **SOLID Principles Assessment**: Evaluate adherence to SOLID principles based on findings
4. **Security and Performance Review**: Assessment of security and performance-related findings
5. **Improvement Recommendations**: Specific, actionable recommendations for addressing findings
6. **Learning Opportunities**: Educational insights for the student based on the analysis

### Grading Considerations:
- Higher severity findings should have more impact on the grade
- Consider the quantity and distribution of findings across different categories
- Evaluate whether the student demonstrates understanding of software engineering principles
- Assess if the code follows professional development standards

Be thorough in your analysis but focus on the most impactful findings that demonstrate software engineering maturity and understanding.
