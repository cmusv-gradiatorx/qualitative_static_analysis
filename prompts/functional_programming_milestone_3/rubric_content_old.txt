# ArbitrageGainer - Functional Programming Assignment Evaluation Rubric

## Project Context
You are evaluating an implementation of **ArbitrageGainer**, a cryptocurrency arbitrage trading system built with functional programming principles. The system identifies and executes arbitrage opportunities across multiple cryptocurrency exchanges (Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Kraken) by:

- Managing user-defined trading parameters
- Identifying cross-traded cryptocurrency pairs
- Calculating historical arbitrage opportunities  
- Executing real-time trading with risk management
- Computing P&L and annualized returns (for 4-person teams)

- **Avoidance of imperative constructs**: No loops, mutations, or object-oriented patterns
- **Side effect management**: Clear separation between pure and impure functions

**Scoring:**
- **Excellent (0.9-1.0)**: Consistent functional approach throughout, masterful use of FP concepts, comprehensive error handling with Result types
- **Good (0.7-0.8)**: Strong functional programming with occasional minor lapses, good use of most FP principles

#### 2.2 Domain-Driven Design Principles (1.0 point)
**Evaluate DDD implementation:**
- **Ubiquitous language**: Clear, business-focused naming throughout the codebase
- **Algebraic type system**: Rich use of discriminated unions, record types, and option types to model domain concepts
- **Business rules in types**: Domain constraints and rules enforced through the type system
- **Domain modeling**: Appropriate entities for trading concepts (Order, ArbitrageOpportunity, TradingParameters, etc.)
- **Onion Architecture**: Clear separation between domain, application, and infrastructure layers
- **Dependency direction**: Dependencies point inward toward the domain core
- **Domain purity**: Domain layer free from external infrastructure concerns

**Scoring:**
